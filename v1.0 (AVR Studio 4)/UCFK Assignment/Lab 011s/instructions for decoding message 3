Packing encoder
The third message is encrypted using a packing scheme.  Here we are going to use a reduced subset of the ASCII table of character codes:

Reduced Code            ASCII Code              Character
(decimal)                       (decimal)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
0                               32                              [space]
1                               33                              !
2                               34                              "
3                               35                              #
4                               36                              $
5                               37                              %
...
60                              92                              \
61                              93                              ]
62                              94                              ^
63                              10                              '\n'

Messages encoded in this scheme contain only one special character --- the Line Feed, LF or '\n' --- a few punctuation characters and only the uppercase characters of the alphabet.  Many early computers were of this form and it is for this reason that a lot of computer systems are case-insensitive.

This reduced set of characters has only 64 members, and therefore they can be uniquely identified using a 6-bit code.  However, the minimum base size of a sequence (word length) is 8 bits.  Therefore in 3 words (24bits) we can encode 4 6-bit reduced code characters.

Message 3 is encoded in this form.  Write a decoder as in the previous two cases to reveal the hidden message.
